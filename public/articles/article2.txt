“According to the Big Bang theory, the dominant scientific theory about the origin of the universe, the universe was created sometime between ten billion and twenty billion years ago when a cosmic explosion hurled matter in all directions. Because of this, we are all energetically connected as one. We all have access to all of the knowledge in the universe; that knowledge is in the form of energy. This means we can access the information needed for healing. We do this through our intuition and intentions. The “library” of this universal knowledge is commonly referred to as “the field.”

Here Adam uses a false hypothesis to prove the energy of the universe is assessable to us all. Putting aside the current belief in evolution that he is promoting, (which constantly changes in theory and time). He wrongly assumes that knowledge is in the form of energy and can be tapped into. This can be proven wrong with some simple experiments. Try talking to your friend on the phone without one. Try recalling the exact conversation you had a year ago. Try talking long distance to them without a phone!

All this is not bothersome to those who want a healing and are gathering in desperation to his healing workshops. This knowledge that was imparted to him by a bird is ignored.
